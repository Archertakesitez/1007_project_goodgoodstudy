## Introduction

The question of what contributes to a billionaire's wealth is both complex and compelling. It reflects the interplay of various factors, from individual decisions to the broader economic environment. Our project aims to identify and understand these factors by examining the common attributes of billionaires. We're not focusing on wealth disparities across the entire economic spectrum; instead, we're zooming in on the uppermost tier of wealth to analyze what sets these individuals apart.

By identifying the features that correlate with higher wealth among billionaires, we hope to shed light on the pathways to extreme financial success. This could include industry participation, geographic location, and other socioeconomic indicators. Understanding these factors can provide valuable insights for aspiring entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers interested in the dynamics at the pinnacle of economic achievement.

Our solutions are all included in [final_project_goodgoodstudy.ipynb](/final_project_goodgoodstudy.ipynb).
